# Privacy Policy for QuoteFlow: Daily Scroll Quotes

Effective date: February 13, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how QuoteFlow: Daily Scroll Quotes ("we", "our", "us") handles information when you use the QuoteFlow: Daily Scroll Quotes mobile app (the "App").

## Information We Collect

We collect limited information needed to operate the App:

- Anonymous account identifier: The App signs in with anonymous authentication and stores a generated user ID.
- App activity data: We may store events such as viewing, saving, unsaving, or sharing quotes, along with timestamps and context (for example, feed type or tag context).
- Saved content: Quotes you save in the App.
- Settings and preferences: Reminder settings, streak information, and other app preferences.
- Technical/service data: Our infrastructure providers may process technical metadata such as IP address, device/app information, and request logs for security and reliability.

We do not ask for your name, phone number, or email address in the App.

## How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Deliver app features (daily quotes, saved quotes, reminders).
- Sync your saved quotes across sessions for your anonymous account.
- Improve reliability, measure feature usage, and prevent abuse.
- Maintain security and debug operational issues.

## Notifications

If you enable reminders, the App schedules local notifications on your device. Notification preferences are stored locally, and may be synced with your app profile settings.

## Sharing of Information

We do not sell personal information.

We may share limited data with service providers that help us operate the App, such as backend/database hosting and infrastructure providers (for example, Supabase). These providers process data on our behalf under contractual obligations.

We may also disclose information when required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.

## Data Retention

We keep data only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described above, including operational, legal, and security needs.

Some data is stored on your device and can be removed by clearing app data or uninstalling the App.

## Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children's Privacy

QuoteFlow: Daily Scroll Quotes may be used by children under 13.

We design the App to limit collection of personal information and do not require children to provide direct contact details like name or email to use core features.

Parents or guardians may contact us to request review or deletion of data associated with a child's app use. See the Contact section below.

## Your Choices

- You can disable notifications in app settings or device settings.
- You can remove locally stored data by clearing app data or uninstalling the App.
- You can request deletion assistance by contacting us.

## International Transfers

Your information may be processed in countries other than your own, depending on where our providers operate.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post updates at the same policy URL and update the effective date.
